# TODO:

- make it possible to see images in dev mode
- implement a validation logic that checks if `a` still works
- add font from `geist` package instead of copying it into the public directory

## highlight code

1. markdown plugin inserts the config into the `data-code-config` attribute
2. introduce `data-show-line-numbers` and `data-highlight-sections` that contains the config from `data-code-config` and `data-parsed-highlight` to indicate that it was parsed (maybe not needed)
